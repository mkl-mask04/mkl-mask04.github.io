            <h1>Lewis Carroll</h1>
            <p>
              Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a
              renowned English writer, mathematician, logician, and
              photographer. He was born on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury,
              Cheshire, England, and passed away on January 14, 1898, in
              Guildford, Surrey, England. Carroll is best known for his
              imaginative literary works, particularly "Alice's Adventures in
              Wonderland" and its sequel, "Through the Looking-Glass."<br /><br />Dodgson
              was the eldest son in a family of eleven children. He displayed an
              early aptitude for mathematics and showed great promise in the
              subject. In 1851, he enrolled at Oxford University's Christ
              Church, where he eventually became a mathematical lecturer and
              remained closely associated with the institution for the rest of
              his life.<br /><br />It was during Dodgson's time at Oxford that
              he began developing the stories that would later become "Alice's
              Adventures in Wonderland." In 1862, while on a boating trip with
              the Liddell family, Dodgson told a tale to entertain the children,
              including Alice Liddell. Encouraged by the positive reception, he
              later expanded the story into a manuscript, and it was published
              in 1865 under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The book's whimsical
              characters, imaginative plot, and clever wordplay made it an
              instant success and a beloved classic of children's literature.<br /><br />Following
              the success of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," Carroll
              published "Through the Looking-Glass" in 1871, which continued the
              fantastical adventures of Alice. Both books garnered critical
              acclaim and have since become enduring classics, celebrated for
              their blend of fantasy, satire, and linguistic playfulness.<br /><br />In
              addition to his literary pursuits, Carroll was also an
              accomplished mathematician and logician. He wrote several books on
              mathematics, including "The Game of Logic" and "Symbolic Logic,"
              which showcased his logical and analytical abilities. Carroll's
              interest in logic and puzzles is evident in his literary works,
              where he employed riddles, paradoxes, and absurd situations.<br /><br />Apart
              from writing and mathematics, Carroll had a passion for
              photography. He was an early adopter of the medium and became
              skilled in the art. Carroll photographed a wide range of subjects,
              including children, famous personalities, and landscapes. His
              photographic work remains influential, particularly his portraits
              of children. <br /><br />Lewis Carroll's life was marked by his
              imaginative and creative endeavors. While his literary works
              brought him widespread fame, he remained a private and somewhat
              enigmatic figure. Carroll's contributions to children's
              literature, mathematics, and photography continue to be
              celebrated, and his works have left an indelible mark on the world
              of imagination and whimsy.
